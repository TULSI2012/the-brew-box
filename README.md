## Purpose and Goal
As a developer, I built this fictional ecommerce website to showcase my skills in creating professional and user friendly websites. I also wanted to improve and refine my skills with React, React Router, React Context and Tailwind CSS.

As always, when starting a new project I like to view some designs from dribbble and take inspiration from modern and sleek designs. This allowed me to brainstorm some ideas for how I want my project to look and the overall structure of the website. I also viewed some current real coffee bean businesses and how they present their information to their customers.

## Highlight
The feature that I am most proud of for this project was the shopping cart functionality. After diving deeper into React context I was able to create a shopping cart that was accessible from any page on the website. Learning how this works is a valuable skill, as it can easily be replicated in other projects down the line.
